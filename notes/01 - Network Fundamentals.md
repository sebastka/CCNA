# 01 - Network Fundamentals

## Definitions

- **LAN**: Local Area Network
- **WAN**: Wide Area Network

- **Internet**: A global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols. Internet is a massive WAN.
- **Network**: A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.

## Data quantities

- 1 byte = 8 bits
- 1 MB = 8 Mb

## Characterizing a network

- **Speed**: The quantity of data per time unit the network is able to transfer. Usually in Mb/s.
- **Delay**: The latency of the connection. Depends on connection type and route from start to end point.
- **Availability**: Whether there is or not an available route to a specific ressource.

## Network topology

- **Star**: Every device is linked to a central switch. Allows the network to function as normal even if one device is disconnected.
- **Ring**: Every device is linked to each other. Allows the network to function one way or another, so it remains unaffected upon rupture of a link.
- **Bus**: Every device is linked to a central link. Upon rupure of the central link, the LAN will be divided in two segments.

One can combine different topologies.
