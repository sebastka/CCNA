# 03 - IPv4

The **I**nternet **P**rotocol version 4 operates at OSI Layer (3) Internet and is a _connectionless_ protocol, meaning no prior arrangement is required to send a message from one point to another. UDP is another connectionless protocol, while TCP is not.

The protocol usually comes with three different pieces of information, where each are four bytes long, as in four numbers from 1 to 255:
- **IP Address**: A device's address
- **Subnet Mask**: Separates the _network_ from the _host_ fields
- **Gateway**: Has to be on the same _network_ as the device

## Classes

IPv4 **classes** are defined by the first byte. This course only deals with class A, B and C:
- **Class A**: 1 - 126
- **Class B**: 128 - 191
- **Class C**: 192 - 223
- **Class D**: 224 - 239 (for multicast)
- **Class E**: 240 - 255 (for experimental purposes)

Addresses starting with 127 are loopbacks.

### Class C

The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, which gives:
- **Network Id** (first): 192.168.100.0
- Valid IP Address start: 192.168.100.1
- Valid IP Address end: 192.168.100.254
- **Broadcast Id** (last): 192.168.100.255

There are 2^8 - 2 = 254 different _hosts_ available.

### Class B

The subnet mask is 255.255.0.0, which gives:
- **Network Id** (first): 172.123.0.0
- Valid IP Address start: 172.123.0.1
- Valid IP Address end: 172.123.255.254
- **Broadcast Id** (last): 172.123.255.255

There are 2^16 - 2 = 65 534 different _hosts_ available.

### Class A

The subnet mask is 255.0.0.0, which gives:
- **Network Id** (first): 100.0.0.0
- Valid IP Address start: 100.0.0.1
- Valid IP Address end: 100.255.255.254
- **Broadcast Id** (last): 100.255.255.255

There are 2^24 - 2 = 2 097 150 different _hosts_ available.
